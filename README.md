You will be given a random number at the start of the game.

           There are four Heads of State below.

           You win the game by matching your total score to the random number.

           You lose the game if your total score goes above the random number.

           The value of each Head of State is hidden from you until you click on it.

          Each time when the game starts, the game will change the values of each Head of State.
